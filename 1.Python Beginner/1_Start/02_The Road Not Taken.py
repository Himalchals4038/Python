print ("The Road Not Taken")
print("Poet: Robert Frost")

''' This poem is very close to my heart as it reminds me of the flaws of our Indian Education System.
It prevents students from studying what they want and choosing their own career.
It sets up predefined paths in which I was also forced to tread to make fortune and enjoy a financially-stable life.'''

print('''Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,

And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”
took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.''')

# You can use numbers and only some symbols after the variable starts qith alphabet or underscore.

# For string variables both single and double coat is used. We use triple coat when we include single and double coat inside our string. 
# For true and false we don't need to put them in any coat as they are Boolean expressions.
# None is used as null quantity when output of the program comes to nothing. 

# Printing variables

print(a)

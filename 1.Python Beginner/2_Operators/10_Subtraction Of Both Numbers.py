'''Program to find the difference of both numbers, whichever is the bigger and smaller number.'''

a = input("Enter the first number: ")
b = input("Enter the second number: ")
a = int(a)
b = int(b)
c = abs(a-b)

# abs function is like mod of JEE Maths.

print("The difference of both numbers is: ",c)

ok so this is my first time trying to type without looking at the keyboard 
of course I have to backslash a lot of times and even look at the keyboard if I can't find the specific word
so this is me in Kota Rajasthan and Adv result will be out on 11th 
in the day of exam I had to change computer multiple times 
it is so hard and extremely stressful to keep my brain cool and focused
so God intentionally destroyed my exam so that I can't score good and suffer
I have already stopped believing in God and won't even start believing anytime soon
currently i am learning python as it is supposed to be a very easy language with no pre knowledge 
I am about to finish my basics and move into intermediate python to learn more advanced stuff 
python curretly supports app development web development and several other back end as well as front end stuff
after Python I am planning on doing JavaScript and c++ so that I atleast have general idea of both the languages
